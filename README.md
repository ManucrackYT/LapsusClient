## Using the installation scripts

An easy way to install Lapsus Client is by using our script, simply run this command as root. The script will do everything for you.
**Before using the script, check you have 
a supported NodeJS version installed on your system**

```bash
bash <(curl -s https://script.lapsusdev.tech)
```

_Note: On some systems, it's required to be already logged in as root before executing the one-line command (where `sudo` is in front of the command does not work)._
