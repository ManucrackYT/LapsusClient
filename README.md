## Using the installation scripts

An easy way to install Lapsus Client is by using our script, simply run this command as root. The script will do everything for you.
**Before using the script, check you don't have NodeJS installed on your system**

```bash
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lapsusdevs/LapsusClient-EGG/main/install.sh)
```

_Note: On some systems, it's required to be already logged in as root before executing the one-line command (where `sudo` is in front of the command does not work)._
